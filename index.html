                   <p> Hi, my name is Ivy. I am a graphic designer and have been working for a movie production/distribution company as a full time designer.
                   
                    Recently, I've been interested in coding and this should be representing my progress in programming. 
                   Since I have no previous knowledge of coding, it must be a slow process. 
                   However, I'm sure I'll be enjoying this learning opportunities and working hard to master in this new tool of programing.
                   My ultimate goal with mastering this new tool is to intergrate my graphic art into the technical frame of coding, a synergy of art & technology. 
                   </p>
